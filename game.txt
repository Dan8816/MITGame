If you so desire, you can add a new MagicLocker outside your Home. In this MagicLocker you can find some tools that will be useful in 
your time at MIT (and beyond). There you can find portals to other places, you can write notes, and you can store various items you 
collect in your travels in the MagicLocker. But first you need to go to the AthenaCluster and learn how.
